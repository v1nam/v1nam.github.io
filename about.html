            Hey there, I am Vinam, a 14 year old programmer interested in various fields of Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favourite programming languages are Rust and Python, and I started programming in September 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
            I really like working in a linux environment, and that's what I use as my daily driver.
            <br>
            I use a tiling window manager, my most common text editor is neovim, I also like working on vscode when i am
            doing Web Dev. I also like doing most of my work through the CLI, and my favourite terminal emulator is
            kitty.
